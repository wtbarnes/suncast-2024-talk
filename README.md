# synthesizAR: A Python Framework for Forward-modeling Optically-thin Emission

Slides for my talk at the [2024 SUNCAST Workshop](https://sites.google.com/njit.edu/suncast2024/).
This talk is an overview of the [`synthesizAR` package](https://github.com/wtbarnes/synthesizAR) with an eye towards how this is related to the GX Simulator package.
